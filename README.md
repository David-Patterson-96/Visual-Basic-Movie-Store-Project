# Visual-Basic-Movie-Store-Project
This was the final project for a Visual Basic II programming class I attended at Copper Mountain Community College and was created with Microsoft Visual Studio. The purpose of this Visual Basic Movie Store program is to get the userâ€™s information such as name and mailing address and to calculate the amount of DVD and/or Blu-Ray movies that the user have ordered along with the total price of said order. If the user has bought over $50 of movies in total, then the user will receive a ten percent discount on the total price. Once the order is finished, the user can print out the order form or clear out the information the user has filled in either to place another order or exit out of the program.
